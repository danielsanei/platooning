## Overview
The Platooning project aims to develop an autonomous car system capable of safely deploying an automated convoy which implements self-driving, adaptive cruise control, and lane switching. This project was conducted under the guidance of Professor Jack Silberman and fellow staff for MAE/ECE 148 (Introduction to Autonomous Vehicles) during the Fall 2024 quarter.
